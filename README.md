## The Giant 7 Segment LED Timer

This timer was first used back in 2014 i guess at the time of Mindbend|The technical fest of SVNIT.

The goal of this repo is to make the hardware functioning again and maintain a codebase for present and future developments.

we have been using 2 atmega 32 communicating via UART as our micro-controller.
Real time clock DS1307 via i2c.
